\title{Algorithm to check Liveness with\\Transition-based Fairness Constraints}

\maketitle

We are given a set of symmetric types $\mathcal{Y}$ and a set of
parametrized transitions $T$, where each $t \in
T$ is parametrized by by a set $p_t$ of symmetric
parameters, where each $p \in p_t$ has a type drawn from
$\mathcal{Y}$. Further, we are also given a set of fairness
constraints $F$. Each fairness constraint $f \in F$ is a set of
parametrized transitions $\{t_{f1}, t_{f2}, ... t_{fn_f}\}$. 
We require that every transition of a fairness constraint
$f \in F$ be parametrized by the same set of parameters $p_f$.

Suppose we are given an $\omega$-automaton $A$, parametrized over a
set of parameters $p_{\omega}$, we want to check if
starting from some initial state $s_0$, executing the product of the
transitions $T$ and the transitions of the automaton $A$ results in an
accepting cycle, when each $f \in F$ is instantiated with an
appropriate set of parameters $p_f \subseteq p_{\omega}$.
What follows is an adaptation of Sistla's algorithm
in this setting.

\begin{itemize}
\item
$\overline{u}.\mathtt{dfnum}$ -- Same as in paper
\item
$\overline{u}.\mathtt{onstack}$ --- Same as in paper
\item
$\overline{u}.\mathtt{perm}$ --- The exact set of permutations that
of the set of parameters $P$ that were applied on the path from $s_0$.
\item
$I^k$ stored in each state $\overline{u}$ as a component of the AQSI,
is a $|p_{\omega}|$-tuple, with one element indicating the current
value of each parameter.
\item

$\overline{u}.\mathtt{partition}$
