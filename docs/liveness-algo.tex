\title{Algorithm to check Liveness with\\Transition-based Fairness Constraints}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

We are given a set of symmetric types $\mathcal{Y}$ and a set of symmetric
variables $P$, where each variable $p \in P$ has a type drawn from
$\mathcal{Y}$. We have a set of state variables $V$, where each $v \in V$
has a type and is optionally parametrized by a set of parameter variables
$P_v \in P$. $T$, is a set of transitions where each $t \in
T$ is parametrized by by a set $P_t \subseteq P$ of symmetric
parameters variables. Further, we are also given a set of fairness
constraints $\mathcal{F}$. Each fairness constraint $F \in \mathcal{F}$ is
a set of parametrized transitions $\{t_{F1}, t_{F2}, ... t_{Fn_f}\}$. 
We require that every transition of a fairness constraint
$F \in \mathcal{F}$ be parametrized by the same set of parameters $P_F$. We
then say that the fairness constraint $F$ is parametrized by variables $P_F$.

Suppose we are given an $\omega$-automaton $A$, parametrized over a
set of parameters $P_{\omega}$, we want to check if
starting from some initial state $s_0$, executing the product of the
transitions $T$ and the transitions of the automaton $A$ results in an
accepting cycle, when each $F \in \mathcal{F}$ is instantiated with an
appropriate set of parameters $P_F \subseteq P_{\omega}$.
What follows is an adaptation of Sistla's algorithm
in this setting.

\begin{itemize}
\item
$\overline{u}.\mathtt{dfnum}$ -- Same as in paper
\item
$\overline{u}.\mathtt{onstack}$ --- Same as in paper
\item
$\overline{u}.\mathtt{perm}$ --- The exact set of permutations
of the set of parameters $P_{\omega}$ that were applied on the path from $s_0$.
\item
$I^k$ stored in each state $\overline{u}$ as a component of the AQSI,
is a $|p_{\omega}|$-tuple, with one element indicating the current
value of each parameter $p \in p_{\omega}$.
\item
$\overline{u}.\mathtt{partition}$ is a set of sets of cardinality
  $|P_{\omega}|$, such that $\overline{u}.\mathtt{partition}$ contains a
  set $s$, that has cardinality $|\mathtt{type}(p)|$ for each $p \in
  P_{\omega}$.
\item
$\overline{u}.\mathtt{final}$ denotes that an accepting state has been 
  encountered in the current SCC.
\end{itemize}
