* Set of tracked indices: 
** For each process with fairness constraints
*** Have a vector with an index element for each symmetric parameter of the process
*** Permute each index element the usual way, given a permutation

** For fairness constraints:
*** Each fairness constraint also has a set of index types/vars corresponding to the 
    process it belongs to.
*** Whenever a transition in the fairness constraint is enabled, set its enabled bit
*** Whenever a transition in the fairness constraint is taken, set its executed bit
*** When a maximal SCC is computed, for each partition (or cross product of partitions, 
    if multiple index types are present), check that some enabled/executed bit in the partition
    satisfies the fairness constraint
